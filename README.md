# BNSClans is deprecated. To look up clans in Blade & Soul you can use this alternative: https://bnstools.info/ 

Altough BNStools doesnt include many of the features from BNSClans, I have no intention of maintaining this hobby project. The site is unreachable since there's no proper .NET website host that doesn't include a fee.

## What is BNSClans
BNSClans (name not final) is a website for players in the MMORPG "Blade & Soul". It's designed to make it easier for players to organize their clans, a feature which is slightly lacking in-game.

    Compare clans and view rankings

    Overview of all registered clans

    Export and view clan avatars
