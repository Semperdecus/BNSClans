# BNSClans
Yo I have this open innovation class where I can do whatever I want as long as it helps my education in some way. I also need proof people are interested in my idea. Most people go to businesses and take surveys but I think this is a better way to get an honest response from people who would benefit from my idea/product.

**Here was my idea:** Make something similar to http://www.runehead.com/clans/ml.php?clan=downfallmain but then for blade and soul. So basically a clan list which you can open from outside the game and which has a lot more features.

**Some features I had in mind for this website were:**
* Raid manager: 1 button click to show you an overview of optimal for raid groups keeping in mind class roles, stats and availability times. Pretty much what you spent planning out every week but then 100x faster.
* Sorting: the webpage will show you a list of members and you can sort them on any stat or even stage soul.
* Activity checker: a way to show you when the last change in stats were made for each member.

I was also wondering if you would rather have every clan's memberlist **public or private** unless a leader would contact me. In a sense all data is already public so no real breach of privacy was made.

Please fill out the following survey but I'd like to keep this survey to clan leaders and managers from blade and soul only.

Thanks for your cooperation!
